            <p>My name is Matthew, I don't like being called Matt.
                I was born in Sandy, Utah. I served a mission in the Alabama Birmingham mission. I've been married
                for 3 years now!
                I Love the Lord of the Rings movies. I love the fantasy genre. I love playing D&D with my family and
                friends.
                I paint minatures whenever I get the time to.
                I love my hobbies and find joy in them.
                I love spending time with my wife Janessa. She makes me smile and laugh everyday without fail.

            <p>Lord of the Rings is heavily inspired by christian beliefs.
                It was written during WW2 and has themes of darkness, war, and hope.
                Tolkien invented his very own languages for Lord of The Rings! He made the entire elvish language
                before writting the first book.
                Though fantasy existed before. The Lord of The rings set the standard for modern fantasy story
                telling - complete with maps, invented histories,
                different races, and a deep mythology.
                Tolkien wrote the three books by hand!
                Tolkien clarified that Middle-Earth isn't another planet. It's actually our own world, thousands of
                years in the past, before recorded history.
